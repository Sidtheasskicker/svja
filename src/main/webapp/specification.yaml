  title: Super Vulnerable Java Application
  description: |-
    The RDPS Super Vulnerable Java Application is just that -- a super vulnerable java application created for the benefit of all to see a variety of common, often "complex", vulnerabilities. This software was created as part of the Roniel and DaRon Podcast Show (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbj1JFcSJeTuf3qf9GPRemA) so that we could discuss and show a number of vulnerabilities that we came across frequently in a more realistic way than what you will see with the many other tools online. To see example exploitation, please watch our podcast.
